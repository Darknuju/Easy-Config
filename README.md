# What is Easy Config?
Easy Config is a [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org) library that makes working with config files much easier, more efficient, more useful, and more robust.

## Why should I use Easy Config?
Easy Config makes creating and manipulating a config file, or many config files, much quicker and easier. Almost all of the background work normally implemented with configs is done automatically with only a few lines of code. Generating the file if it doesn't exist and loading values into memory primarily.

In addition to making configuration easier to implement, Easy Config also adds easy to implement customizable features such as a command that allows server admins to edit your configuration in-game, in real time, and, depending on how the library is used, without unnecessary read/write to the disk, or the ability to backup your configuration and revert to that backup.

## The configuration I am using is very complex/requires a feature that Easy Config doesn't support
This library was a personal project for me to learn and grow. I have done my best to add as much as I can and will continue to, but I can't add everything or think of every specific a situation a developer would need a certain feature for their config. Easy Config will not apprehend regular use of the config as one of the project's goals is to offer choice to the developer and the server admin. Everything available to you without the use of Easy Config is still available with Easy Config with as little as possible obscured. If you really want to use Easy Config and a feature that Easy Config doesn't have feel free to contribute here on GitHub. This is an open source project after all. :)

## Can I contribute to bug fixes and adding new features?
Absolutely! Check out the contributing page on the wiki [here](https://github.com/Darknuju/Easy-Config/wiki/Contributing).
