# Easy Config

Easy Config is a library built for [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org) to improve the functionality and ease of use of configuration files.

It is currently a WIP personal project of mine.

## Features:
- In-Game real time configuration editing without reloading plugin.
- Memory and disk read/write optimization.
- Config backup.
- Customizable auto config save event.
